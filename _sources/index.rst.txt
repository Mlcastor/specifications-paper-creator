Specification Paper Creator
===========================

Introduction
------------

The Specification Paper Creator is a project that utilizes a Crew of Agents to generate specification papers based on client requirements. The Crew engages in a deep questioning process to gather all necessary information about the client's project and leverages web search capabilities to select the most suitable technologies for the specific use case.

Target Audience
---------------

The Specification Paper Creator is primarily intended for software engineers and freelancers who require specification papers for computer science problems. However, the project aims to expand its accessibility to a broader audience through the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

Key Features
------------

- Crew of Agents: The project employs a Crew of Agents that ask probing questions to the client to obtain comprehensive information about their project requirements.
- Technology Selection: The Crew has the ability to search the web and identify the most appropriate technologies for the client's specific use case.
- Specification Paper Generation: Based on the gathered information and selected technologies, the Crew generates a tailored specification paper.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use the Specification Paper Creator, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Software engineering knowledge (current requirement, planned to be expanded to non-developers)
- Groq API key (an Ollama-based solution is planned for the future)

Installation
------------

To set up the Specification Paper Creator project, follow these steps:

1. Obtain a Groq API key.
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Set up the environment using either:
   - Conda with the provided .yaml file, or
   - Venv with the requirements.txt file
4. Configure the .env file with your Groq API key using the .env.example file as a reference.
5. Run the project using the command: `python -m`
